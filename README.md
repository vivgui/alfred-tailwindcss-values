# Alfred workflow for Tailwind CSS values

This alfred workflow accepts a pixel value and gives you the approximate value following Tailwind CSS's scale, which uses a factor of 4. 

You activate it with the `twv` keyword and it accepts a number (in pixels). If you press `enter` on the selection it will be automatically copied to your clipboard.

I may add the capability of using rem values in the future if there's interest.
